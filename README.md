## ðŸ”‘ Key Features  

### ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing Pipeline  
- **FIR band-pass filtering (order 100)** to remove drifts and noise.  
- **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)** for ocular and muscular artifact removal.  

### ðŸ“Š Feature Extraction  
- **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)** to extract **Energy** and **Shannon Entropy** features.  
- Sub-band analysis for: **Low/High Alpha, Beta, and Gamma frequency bands**.  

### ðŸ”„ Synthetic Data Generation  
- **TVAE (Tabular Variational Autoencoder) Synthesizer** to address class imbalance.  
- Achieved **93% data quality**, enhancing model generalization.  

### ðŸ¤– Classification  
- Emotion categories: **Positive, Neutral, Depressed, Anxiety**.  
- Supports multiple ML algorithms: **Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks**.  
- **5-fold cross-validation** for robust performance evaluation.  

### ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics  
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix
